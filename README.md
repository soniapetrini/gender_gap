## *An account of gender inequality*

### THESIS OVERVIEW
The gender gap can be seen as a matter of uneven distribution of rights, opportunities, and benefits between men and women.
Starting from the definition of this phenomenon, this thesis describes its evolution across years and countries, exploiting the
*World Economic Forum*'s Gender Gap Index as a benchmark for evaluation.

After locating the main weakness in economic participation and opportunity, the focus moves over the Gender Pay Gap, which represents a
quantitative measure of inequality. Having shifted from a qualitative to a quantitative framework, it is possible to introduce
the econometric technique proposed by Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973) to decompose the wage gap, allowing for the identification of the 
differential's component not explained by differences in productivity.

Finally, the resulting decomposition is deeply analyzed, by investigating the roots of discrimination and gender polarization through
the words of the brilliant Iris Marion Young ("Justice and the Politics of Difference", 1990).
